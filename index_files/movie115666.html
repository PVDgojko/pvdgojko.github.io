  <br><p><b>Description: </b>In Atlanta on business, straight-laced and overly analytical architect Peter Highman is flying home to Los Angeles and his wife Sarah for the imminent birth of their first child. However, traveling by plane no longer becomes an option when he and a fellow passenger, aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay, are kicked off the plane, which was caused by Ethan&#039;s social inappropriateness, due to being generally unaware, exacerbated by Peter&#039;s temper at a situation against his sensibilities. Peter, who ends up without money or his suitcase, is forced to accept Ethan&#039;s offer of a shared car ride to Los Angeles, Ethan who is looking for his big acting break. For Peter, this partnership is one made in hell, but he feels he has no other choice. Peter obviously wants to take as direct and as quick a route as possible, while he is at Ethan&#039;s mercy as the person with the driver&#039;s license, car rental and money. They get into one misadventure after another on this trip, with the same issue at each ...</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>Director Todd Phillips re-teams with his break-out Hangover star Zach Galifianakis for this road movie concerning a soon-to-be father (played by Robert Downey Jr.) and his cross-country trip to make it back in time for his baby&#039;s birth—with the only roadblock being the dubious passenger (Galifianakis) who&#039;s along for the ride. Michelle Monaghan and Jamie Foxx co-star in the Warner Bros./Legendary Pictures production.
