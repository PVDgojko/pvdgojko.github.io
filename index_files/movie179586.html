  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Norval&#039;s life has been, to put it lightly, difficult. Currently living home with his mother, the troubled young man is coming off alcohol-related struggles. So when he receives an unexpected letter from his estranged father requesting a visit, Norval catches a bus up to his dad&#039;s secluded and scenic waterfront home. Maybe reconnecting with his father will give Norval the emotional fulfillment he&#039;s been lacking. Before long, though, he notices something off about his dad, an uneasy feeling triggered by inappropriate comments and a possible over-dependence on booze. Norval quickly realizes that his hope of father/son bonding is doomed. Instead of a family reunion, he finds himself in waking nightmare.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A man in his thirties travels to a remote cabin to reconnect with his estranged father.
