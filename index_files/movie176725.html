Baburao is a landlord in India, who is very near-sighted, and always in financial trouble. He has a tenant named Raja, who has not paid his rent for several months. He also has anther tenant named Shyam, who has come to the city to look for a job in his late father&#039;s place, but is unable to find employment. The three men quarrel amongst themselves frequently. Then one day, the three men get a phone call from a kidnapper named Kabira, and decide to make use of this phone call to overcome their financial problems - pretend to be the real kidnappers, increase the ransom amount, keep the incremental amount for themselves, and then give the original ransom demanded to Kabira. Will they get away with this idea?

-------

Shyam (Sunil Shetty), an unemployed youth and Raju (Akshay Kumar), a laundry worker are boarders at the home of mechanic Baburao (hilarious Paresh Rawal). Each dreams of making it big, and one evening, a cross-connection on their phone lets them in on a kidnapping scheme that they figure can lead them to the big bucks. The film has one of the most hilarious sequences in Hindi cinema, when bank manager Asrani tries to hook up Shyam with Anuradha (Tabu), to the amusement of a by-stander (Snehal Dabi) who mistakes Asrani for a pimp. Great cameo byOm Puri as a beleaguered Punjabi truck driver.

-------

Ghanshyam "Shyam" (Sunil Shetty) comes to Bombay from a small village to claim a job with a bank that employed his late father, Sunderlal, who was killed while the bank caught fire several years. According to rules and regulations, the bank must hire him in his father&#039;s place. Competing with him is the daughter of yet another employee, who was also killed in the fire, Anuradha Shivshankar Panikar (Tabu). Shyam rooms with a myopic but kind-hearted garage owner, Baburao Apte (Paresh Rawal), who has also rented another of his rooms&#039; to Raju (Akshaye Kumar), who dreams of making it big in the city but is currently broke and unable to pay rent for several months now. Shyam has come to the city so that he can return Rs.35000/- he borrowed from Kharak Singh (Om Puri), who in turn needs the money to get his sister married. Baburao needs money to pay off his debtors. And to add to this chaos, Baburao keeps on getting a series of wrong numbers on his telephone, asking for Deviprasad. One day he gets a call from Kabira (Gulshan Grover) who demands a ransom from Baburao, thinking it is Deviprasad (Kulbhushand Kharbanada). The trio decide to "liase" between the victim&#039;s dad and the kidnappers, and keep some of the money for themselves. Murphy&#039;s Law prevails, and things get even more hilariously chaotic, as the trio are on the run from Kabeera; the police; more wrong numbers; and Kharak Singh.

-------

Raju and Shyam are boarders at a hostel owned by their friend Babu Rao. All the three friends are in dire need (and have fantasies) of big money. Babu Rao needs money to pay back debts his father incurred, Raju needs money to send to his mother and Shyam needs money to pay back Kharak Singh, a villager friend with a wedding to arrange quickly. Of these, Shyam is the only one to get a job, but he sacrifices it to Anu, a woman with serious troubles (and with whom he eventually develops a hate-to-love relationship). One day, a gangster named Kabira kidnaps the granddaughter of millionaire Devi Prasad. But when he calls Babu Rao&#039;s telephone number by mistake to demand the ransom, Raju sees the answer to all their money problems. He suggests they play a game, and do some "hera pheri" - and that&#039;s when the trouble starts...</p>
