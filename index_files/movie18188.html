  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Having been away for four months, Hildy Johnson walks into the offices of the New York City based The Morning Post, where she is a star reporter, to tell her boss, editor Walter Burns, that she is quitting. The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn&#039;t want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn&#039;t believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce&#039;s trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan ...</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>The second screen version of the Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur play The Front Page, His Girl Friday changed hard-driving newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson from a man to a woman, transforming the story into a scintillating battle of the sexes. Rosalind Russell plays Hildy, about to foresake journalism for marriage to cloddish Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, Hildy&#039;s editor and ex-husband, who feigns happiness about her impending marriage as a ploy to win her back. The ace up Walter&#039;s sleeve is a late-breaking news story concerning the impending execution of anarchist Earl Williams (John Qualen), a blatant example of political chicanery that Hildy can&#039;t pass up. The story gets hotter when Williams escapes and is hidden from the cops by Hildy and Walter—right in the prison pressroom. His Girl Friday may well be the fastest comedy of the 1930s, with kaleidoscope action, instantaneous plot twists, and overlapping dialogue. And if you listen closely, you&#039;ll hear a couple of "in" jokes, one concerning Cary Grant&#039;s real name (Archie Leach), and another poking fun at Ralph Bellamy&#039;s patented "poor sap" screen image. Subsequent versions of The Front Page included Billy Wilder&#039;s 1974 adaptation, which restored Hildy Johnson&#039;s manhood in the form of Jack Lemmon, and 1988&#039;s Switching Channels, which cast Burt Reynolds in the Walter Burns role and Kathleen Turner as the Hildy Johnson counterpart.
