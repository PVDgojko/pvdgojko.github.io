Judging from the recent releases, it seems that the Korean horror film genre is improving by leaps and bounds. From the absolutely fantastic “Black House” to the well thought out “Muoi : The Portrait of the Legend” to the promising “Epitath” and now – the medical students have gone nuts – “The Cut”. All of these films are significantly better than the horror films released the past couple of years – which felt like they were cranked out of Chungmuro in the same assembly line manner as they crank out memory chips and cellphones.

“The Cut” is a crazy horror/mystery film centered around six freshman medical students as they prepare to take part in their first human dissection. The students are : Sun-Hwa (intelligent but slightly aloof), Ki-Bum (caring leader of the group but has an odd fetish), Joong-Suk (prankster that likes to party when the time is right), Eun-Joo (top medical student but has a fear of human cadavers), Kyung-Min (eats junk food even during dissections), Ji-Young (not all that interested in becoming a doctor but seriously interested in becoming Chan-yong’s girlfriend).

On the first day of their anatomy class, the students are presented with the cadaver of an attractive woman with a rose tattooed on her chest. Joong-suk in bad taste snaps pictures of the cadaver with his cellphone. Meanwhile, Eun-Joo’s hands shake while attempting her first incision. Their instructor, Professor Han, admonishes Eun-Joo for her lack of professionalism. She ends up running out of the class room.

That evening Eun-Joo decides to go to the anatomy classroom to practice using the scalpel and conquer her fear of cadavers. The next morning Eun-Joo is found dead with her heart cut out of her chest. The students are all shocked and wonder who could have done such a thing – was it one of them? When another student is found murdered in the same manner they now start to wonder if it could be caused by supernatural forces. The students all have had similar dreams involving the same cadaver and a one-eyed man The race is now on to uncover the truth.

While “The Cut” is unabashedly a horror film the most appealing aspects about the movie would be the mystery elements in the film. Who is killing the students? Is Joong-Suk’s well connected father involved in some manner? Is Ki-Bum a necrophiliac? What exactly is Sun-Hwa’s story? What are Professor Han’s true motives? What exactly happened to the woman with the rose tattoo?

Once those mysteries start to unravel in the later parts of the film, the movie hits you with a combination of camp, horror, shock and confusion. Strap on your seatbelt and get ready for a wild ride if you decide to watch The Cut.
