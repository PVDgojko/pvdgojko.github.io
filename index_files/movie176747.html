  <br><p><b>Description: </b>USA in the 1970s. We follow the highly intelligent Jack over a span of 12 years and are introduced to the murders that define Jack&#039;s development as a serial killer. We experience the story from Jack&#039;s point of view, while he postulates each murder is an artwork in itself. As the inevitable police intervention is drawing nearer, he is taking greater and greater risks in his attempt to create the ultimate artwork. Along the way we experience Jack&#039;s descriptions of his personal condition, problems and thoughts through a recurring conversation with the unknown Verge - a grotesque mixture of sophistry mixed with an almost childlike self-pity and psychopathic explanations. The House That Jack Built is a dark and sinister story, yet presented through a philosophical and occasional humorous tale.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>The story follows Jack, a highly intelligent serial killer, over the course of twelve years, and depicts the murders that really develop his inner madman.
