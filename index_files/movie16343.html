A serial killer known as "The Avenger" is on the loose in London, murdering blonde women. A mysterious man arrives at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting looking for a room to rent. The Bunting&#039;s daughter is a blonde model and is seeing one of the detectives assigned to the case. The detective becomes jealous of the lodger and begins to suspect he may be the avenger.

-------

In London, a young, somewhat aloof man rents a room in the rooming house owned and operated by the Buntings. To Mrs. Bunting, the rent trumps the fact of his odd behavior, that oddness including he asking for the photographs of the young women in his room to be removed. As time progresses, Mrs. Buntings believes their new lodger is the Avenger, a serial killer who has been targeting young, blonde women, one victim every Tuesday evening for the past several weeks, performers in the Golden Curls revue in particular fear, they all donning blonde wigs when performing. If Mrs. Bunting is correct, she may have saved their daughter, Daisy Bunting, a model and a blonde at that, she who has started to develop feelings for the lodger. If Mrs. Bunting is incorrect, she may tragically have sealed the lodger&#039;s fate both in the public having a mob mentality in wanting the Avenger put away for good, and in an acquaintance named Joe, a police detective, having recently assumed the lead in the case, he who didn&#039;t much like the lodger to begin with as he sees Daisy as his girl.

-------

A serial killer known as "the avenger" is murdering blonde women in London. A new lodger, Jonathan Drew, arrives at Mr. and Mrs. Bounting&#039;s in Bloomsbury and rents a room. The man has some strange habits, he goes out during foggy nights and keeps a picture of a blonde girl in his bedroom. The Bounting&#039;s daughter, Daisy, is a blonde model and she is engaged to Joe, a detective. When Joe finds out that Bounting suspects Jonathan, he is jealous of the lodger flirting with Daisy and arrests the man accusing him of being the avenger.</p>
