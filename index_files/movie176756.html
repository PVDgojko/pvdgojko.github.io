The story follows Rachel Chu (Wu), an American-born Chinese economics professor, who travels to her boyfriend Nick&#039;s (Golding) hometown of Singapore for his best friend&#039;s wedding. Before long, his secret is out: Nick is from a family that is impossibly wealthy, he&#039;s perhaps the most eligible bachelor in Asia, and every single woman in his ultra-rarefied social class is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down.

-------

The story follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Wu) as she accompanies her boyfriend, Nick Young (Golding), to his best friend&#039;s wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick&#039;s family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country&#039;s wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick&#039;s arm puts a target on Rachel&#039;s back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick&#039;s own disapproving mother (Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can&#039;t buy love, it can definitely complicate things.

In 1995, the Young family arrive at a London hotel to check in, but are denied their reservation by racist staff. In response, they purchase the hotel, forcing the staff to give them their room. Forwarding to 2018, Rachel Chu, an economics professor at New York University, is eating at a cafe with her boyfriend Nick Young after teaching a lecture. She accepts an invitation to accompany him to Singapore for his best friend Colin and his fiancee Araminta&#039;s wedding. The day after arriving in Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when Rachel tells them that she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin explains the history of Nick&#039;s family fortune and the fanfare surrounding Colin&#039;s wedding, warning Rachel that Nick&#039;s high-society family and friends will be overly critical of her, though Rachel is unconcerned. At a dinner party at Nick&#039;s family home, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother, Eleanor, while Nick&#039;s cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael has been having an affair. Rachel worries that Eleanor dislikes her, although she seems to make a good impression on Nick&#039;s grandmother, Su Yi..</p>
