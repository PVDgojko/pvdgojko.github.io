  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Brandon is a 30-something man living in New York who is unable to manage his sex life. After his wayward younger sister moves into his apartment, Brandon&#039;s world spirals out of control. Shame examines the nature of need, how we live our lives and the experiences that shape us.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>An outwardly ordinary man must come to terms with his inner compulsions in this powerful drama from filmmaker Steve McQueen. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a successful businessman in his early thirties who lives in New York. To most around him, Brandon seems cool and introverted, but inside he is wrestling with a powerful sexual appetite; he&#039;s obsessed with pornography and prefers short-term relationships with women that allow him to keep the world at arm&#039;s length. The grim routine of Brandon&#039;s life is upended when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) stops by for an extended visit without prior notice. While Brandon is reserved, Sissy is an outgoing and flashy musician, and she doesn&#039;t seem to care about her brother&#039;s need for privacy. When Sissy forces Brandon to look closely at his life, he comes to understand the circumstances that made him the man he is today as his veneer of calm begins to crack. Shame won the Firpresci Award (presented by the International Federation of Film Critics) at the 2011 Venice Film Festival.
