Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis, the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil&#039;s Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack&#039;s only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.

-------

Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), a deadly ghost escapes the Devil&#039;s triangle with his crew and is taking over the seas in search of his arch-rival and author of all his pain, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). In the meantime, Jack is approached by a boy who needs to locate the Trident of Poseidon, something he believes only Sparrow can help him find. Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) an astronomer and horologist joins the team to help them find something she believes her father had always wanted her to find. Jack&#039;s only hope is to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon, who&#039;s master gets control of all the seas, or so it&#039;s said.

-------

Twelve-year-old Henry Turner (Lewis McGowan) boards the Flying Dutchman and informs his father, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), that the curse which binds Will to the Dutchman and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the Trident of Poseidon. Henry intends to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident. Nine years later, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) is a sailor in the British Royal Navy. The ship sails into the supernatural Devil&#039;s Triangle and stumbles upon the wreck of the Silent Mary, whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate-hunter Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) attack. Salazar spares Henry&#039;s life to deliver a message to Jack: Salazar is coming for him.

-------

Captain Jack Sparrow&#039;s (Johnny Depp&#039;s) luck has run out. Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) has released the most deadly ghost pirates of the sea from the Devil&#039;s Triangle. Captain Salazar is the oldest villain of Jack Sparrow. The ghost pirates hunt every single pirate at sea, including Jack Sparrow. The only hope to survive this adventure is to collect the legendary Trident of Poseidon. This weapon is the most powerful weapon and the owner gets control of all seas. Is Jack going to collect this powerful weapon and can he ensure he is not going to get killed by Captain Salazar and his pirate ghosts?</p>
