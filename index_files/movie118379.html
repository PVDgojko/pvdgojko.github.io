  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Two children Nam-yi and Ja-in are being chased by King Injo&#039;s guards and saved by their father Choi Pyeong-ryung, an officer of King Gwanghae and a skilled archer. He sends his own children to find a place of refuge with his best friend Kim Mu-seon. As they escape crying, Ja-in begs her brother to go back to their father but their father is killed in front of Nam-yi. Nam-yi, though bitten by the guard dogs, kills them and escapes with Ja-in. Nam-yi becomes the only family Ja-in has. 13 years later Nam-yi is now a skilled archer and hunter. He learns from Mu-seon&#039;s son Seo-goon that he and Ja-in plan to get married, with the approval of Mu-seon who is also Ja-in&#039;s godfather. During the wedding, Nam-yi is up in the mountains hunting deer. He hears the rumble of the invading forces. When Nam-yi makes it back to the village, he finds his step-father slaughtered and his sister taken away. Nam-yi then sets out to find the Qing army and take out their army with his bow.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A 17th Century Korean archer embarks on a treacherous mission to save his younger sister after she is kidnapped by Manchurian soldiers on her wedding day. The year is 1636. Ja-in (Moon Chae-Won) and her longtime love Seo-Goon are about to exchange their wedding vows as the armies of the Qing Dynasty begin attacking villages, and abducting Koreans. In the midst of the chaos, Ja-in is swept away. As the fighting intensifies, Ja-in&#039;s older brother Nam-Yi (The Host&#039;s Park Hae-il}) realizes that the only way he will ever see his sister alive again is to take on the entire Qing Dynasty. Armed with only his bow and arrow, the brave warrior sets out on a mission to reunite his family, or die trying. A sweeping, historical action epic that proved a massive hit in Korea, War of the Arrows received four trophies at the 2011 Daejong Awards.
