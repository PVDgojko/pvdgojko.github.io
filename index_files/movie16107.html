  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Kevin McCallister&#039;s parents have split up. Now living with his mom, he decides to spend Christmas with his dad at the mansion of his father&#039;s rich girlfriend, Natalie. Meanwhile robber Marv Merchants, one of the villains from the first two movies, partners up with a new criminal named Vera to hit Natalie&#039;s mansion.

-------

Christmas this year looks bad to Kevin McCallister. His parents Peter and Kate have been separated for the past 8 months, and things at home with Kate are difficult enough without the bullying dealt to Kevin by his older brother Buzz and older sister Megan. Peter invites Kevin and his siblings to stay with him and his rich new girlfriend Natalie for Christmas. Kate simply offers the kids love and affection. The kids side with Kate, but Kevin is thinking hard about the invitation. On Christmas Eve, Kevin sneaks to Natalie&#039;s place to spend the holidays with Peter. Natalie lives in a mansion where almost everything responds to remote commands. Butler Prescott and kindly housekeeper Molly are at Kevin&#039;s beck and call. Peter and Natalie leave for a while. At Christmas, they will be picking up some house guests at the airport, including an 11-year-old crown prince. Kevin witnesses his old enemy Marv Merchants and Marv&#039;s wife Vera breaking in to case the mansion with the help of an insider who gave Marv a remote control to it. Natalie and Peter don&#039;t believe Kevin, and Prescott says he saw nothing, which makes Kevin think maybe Prescott is the insider. Peter decides they should all trim the Christmas tree, and they do. Kate comes over to bring Kevin some things, and it becomes obvious to Kevin that Kate and Peter still love each other deep down inside. Marv and Vera plan to kidnap the prince and decide to make their move on Christmas morning. Upon learning about this, Kevin rigs the house with booby traps. Come Christmas morning, Kevin is left at the mansion while Natalie and Peter go out to pick up the guests. In their absence, Marv and Vera break in again, looking for the prince. But they didn&#039;t know that they&#039;d find Kevin in there, with a bunch of painful booby traps for them.

-------

Kevin McCallister was invited to his Dad&#039;s girlfriend&#039;s mansion. Kevin accepts the invitation, and has fun until he finds out that his nemesis, Marv, and his wife, Vera, are planning to kidnap the crowned prince, a visitor of the mansion. He floods the bathroom while Marv and Vera were in it. Kevin gets framed for the mess when his Dad came back to the mansion. When Marv and Vera came back on the next day, Kevin smashed their plans by sending them out the window. Natalie, (Dad&#039;s girlfriend,) sees the broken window, and frames Kevin again. On the next day, it was revealed that Molly, Natalie&#039;s maid, was Marv&#039;s accomplice. But Kevin was able to injure the three with traps. The police came and took them. Kevin&#039;s dad and Natalie saw it, and finally believed Kevin about the burglars.</p>
