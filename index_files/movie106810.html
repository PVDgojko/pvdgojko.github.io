  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Schoolteacher and family man Ed Avery, who&#039;s been suffering bouts of severe pain and even blackouts, is hospitalized with what&#039;s diagnosed as a rare inflammation of the arteries. Told by doctors that he probably has only months to live, Ed agrees to an experimental treatment: doses of the hormone cortisone. Ed makes a remarkable recovery, and returns home to his wife, Lou, and their son, Richie. He must keep taking cortisone tablets regularly to prevent a recurrence of his illness. But the "miracle" cure turns into its own nightmare as Ed starts to abuse the tablets, causing him to experience increasingly wild mood swings.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A seriously ill schoolteacher becomes dependent on a "miracle" drug that begins to affect his sanity.
