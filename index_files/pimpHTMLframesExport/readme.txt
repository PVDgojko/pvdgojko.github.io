If you run pimpHTMLframesExport.exe, it will start (immediately) to add some additional features to the exported files.
Links will be added for genres, categories, countries, director names, actor names, and languages of audio tracks, if those
appear in two or more database entries. Depending on the amount of exported data this might result in a few thousand
additional (predominantly small) HTML-files.
To the list's options menu filters will be added for genre, category, and language, if there is sufficient data
available. If you don't use category at all, for example, and the field stays empty throughout your database a category
filter would make no sense. There must be two ore more categories elsewise no category filter will be added.
Some of the additional features will only appear if javascript is enabled in your browser.
pimpHTMLframesExport.exe should be only run once (a second run would break the newly added links). Afterwards (or if you
don't intend to run pimpHTMLframesExport.exe at all) you can safely delete the subfolder "pimpHTMLframesExport".
