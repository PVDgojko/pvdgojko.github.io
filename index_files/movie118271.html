  <br><p><b>Description: </b>In this fast paced action thriller, a taxi driver living in the Yanbian Province of China goes to South Korea when a local gangster offers him to carry out a hit on a professor in return for repaying his debt. In the meanwhile, he also searches for his wife who had come here but had not responded since 6 months. His suspicion of her betrayal makes his tension rise, before something unexpected happens that night on which he is prepared to kill the professor. Soon, he finds himself running for his life from police and the mob, resulting in a lot of violent fights and intense car chases.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>The Chaser director Na Hong-jin returns to deliver this action-packed suspense thriller about a desperate cab driver who stumbles into a treacherous conspiracy after agreeing to perform an assassination in South Korea. Gu-Nam (Ha Jung-woo) drives a taxi in Yanji City. Located between the borders of North Korea and Russia in Northeastern China, Yanji City is home to nearly 100,000 Chinese-Koreans known as Joseonjok. Six months ago, Gu-Nam&#039;s wife traveled to Korea in hopes of earning some extra money. He hasn&#039;t heard from her since. In addition, Gu-Nam has lost a great deal of money at mah-jongg. He gets a rare opportunity to get out of debt, however, when he crosses paths with Myun-ga, a hired killer who recruits him for a one-time job in South Korea. Reasoning that he will have the opportunity to search for his wife while he&#039;s there, Gu-Nam accepts. But shortly after arriving in South Korea, Gu-Nam is framed for another crime. As he flees from the cops, a vicious crime boss (Cho Seung-Ha), and a determined assassin, the terrified cabdriver realizes he has walked right into a deadly trap. Now, unless Gu-Nam can discover who is behind the conspiracy and why he is being hunted through the streets of Seoul, he may never see his beloved wife again.
