-------

In Los Angeles, cashier Audrey Stockton spends her birthday upset after being dumped, via text, by her boyfriend, Drew. Her charismatic best friend and roommate, Morgan, convinces her to burn Drew&#039;s things and sends him a text as a heads up. Unbeknownst to Audrey, Drew is a government agent being pursued by men trying to kill him. He promises to return and asks Audrey not to burn his things in the meantime. At her job, Audrey flirts with a man who asks her to walk him to his car. Outside, he and a colleague force her into a van and he proceeds to tell her he is Sebastian Henshaw and that Drew works for the C.I.A. and has gone missing. Audrey claims not to have heard from Drew and upon returning home, informs Morgan that Drew is a spy. Drew returns to Audrey&#039;s apartment to retrieve his possessions, including a second place trophy he won from fantasy football. People soon begin shooting into the apartment and Drew tells Audrey that, if anything were to happen to him, she must travel to Vienna and turn over the trophy to his contact. Drew is then murdered by a man Morgan had previously met at the bar, who is himself a spy, who is then killed by Morgan by pushing him off the balcony before he can attack Audrey..</p>
