An association of astronomers has convened to listen to the plan of Professor Barbenfouillis, their president, to fly to the moon. With the one dissenting voice quashed by Barbenfouillis and the other members, the plan is approved with Barbenfouillis choosing five others to accompany him. Most of the preparation for the trip is in building the vessel and launching mechanism, which resemble a large bullet and a large gun respectively. Hitting the moon in the eye, the six land safely at their destination. They find that much about the moon is wonderful and fantastical, but also that much is not what they would have liked to encounter as it is life threatening. They have to find a way to get out of their alien predicament to get back home safely.

Comprised of 30 spectacular tableaux and using 18 fabulously elaborate decors, the innovative and audacious director, Georges Méliès, presents its audience with an imaginative, turn-of-the-century fantasy extravaganza. Under the intrepid Professor Barbenfouillis&#039; presidency at the renowned Institute of Incoherent Astronomy, its esteemed members all conclude that it is high time they ventured into the great unknown by organising an exploratory expedition to the Moon. Before long, the fearless pioneers will land their bullet-shaped spaceship on the seemingly desolate lunar plains, witnessing firsthand the marvels of deep space, unaware; however, that the hordes of the Moon Emperor&#039;s dreadful Selenites are ready to fend off the intruders. Can the scientists escape from the dangerous but fascinating celestial body?

-------

This early silent film by master artist and film pioneer Georges Melies is considered a classic by many film buffs. Although it runs for only 14 minutes this whimsical fantasy really focuses on an astronomers dream.

-------

A group of astronomers studies the way to travel to the moon. When they conclude their project, the president selects five other astronomers to travel with him. They embark in a shell and are shot from a giant cannon to the moon. When they land, they seek shelter in a cave to protect from the snow. They meet the Selenites, the alien inhabitants of the moon, and they are destroyed by the astronomers who find that a strong hit makes them explode. However, they arrive in large numbers and the astronomers are captured by the Selenites. But one astronomer hits their king who explodes and they run to the capsule pursued by the aliens. They drop the capsule which falls through the space and reaches the ocean. Then they are rescued by a steamer which brings the team safe and sound ashore.</p>
