Together they strangle David with a rope and placing the body in an old chest, they proceed to hold a small party. The guests include David&#039;s father, his fiancée Janet, and their old schoolteacher Rupert, from whom they mistakenly took their ideas.

"It&#039;s supposed to be about homosexuals, and you don&#039;t even see the boys kiss each other," Jean Renoir once said of ROPE. The astute observation wraps its hands around the black heart of the movie, where all things subversive were hidden in plain sight by bisexual screenwriter Arthur Laurents-in brilliant collusion with Hitchcock and the film&#039;s two gay leading stars: Arthur&#039;s lover Farley Granger and John Dall. Hitchcock&#039;s first color production, ROPE&#039;s nihilistic narrative unfolds in deceptively distracting Technicolor as virtually a single continuous shot, with the artful aid of hidden "cuts." Adapted from a stage play based on the infamous 1924 Leopold and Loeb case, in which two young male lovers murdered a 14-year-old boy in cold blood, Laurents&#039; script amplifies the sordid true-crime tale by calling upon Nietzsche&#039;s controversial concept of "the übermensch" to drive sadistic character motivations forth into an inescapable darkness.

Manhattan socialites Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan choke the life out of an associate, David, as an intellectual challenge to commit the perfect murder. Not content to escape the penalty of law by simply disposing of the body quietly, they furthermore devise an elaborate and dangerous display of arrogance: The two stuff David&#039;s lifeless body into a chest and throw a dinner party serving their guests, literally, from the convenient tabletop of the young man&#039;s grave. In attendance are Mr. Henry Kentley and Mrs. Anita Atwater, the victim&#039;s father and aunt; Kenneth Turner, the victim&#039;s rival for the hand of Janet Walker, David&#039;s fiancée, who also attends; Mrs. Wilson, the servant; and Rupert Cadell, the murderers&#039; former teacher whose flippant repartee regarding social caste festered into the pathological short circuit that led to Brandon&#039;s and Phillip&#039;s crime. Brandon&#039;s sense of intellectual superiority swells to reckless levels throughout the evening as he makes a nail-biting game out of cleverly dropping his guests hints at nasty goings on. Meanwhile, Phillip grows increasingly frightful and guilt-ridden as Rupert inches ever closer to discovering why David hasn&#039;t yet arrived at the party.

Two arrogant young men, Philip Morgan and Brandon Shaw, kill a friend for no apparent reason other than to show they can get away with it. They put their victim, David Kentley, in a chest in the living room where they are having a party later that evening. The guests include David&#039;s father and also one of their former teachers, Rupert Cadell. As the evening wears on Brandon, clearly the bolder of the two perpetrators, continually pushes his chances becoming ever bolder. Philip, on the other hand, begins to regret what they have done and combined with too much alcohol, begins to act oddly. All this leading Cadell to start wondering exactly what they have done.</p>
