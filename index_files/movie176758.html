Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.

-------

Bohemian Rhapsody is a movie based on the true story of Queen&#039;s journey from the start of the rock band to their now-legendary 1985 performance at the Live Aid concert in Wembley Stadium. The story chronicles lead singer Freddie Mercury&#039;s tempestuous journey from an outcast immigrant struggling to find his place in a rejecting society to his becoming a beloved and world-famous artist.

-------

In 1970s London, the poor baggage handler at Heathrow Airport--the fiercely ambitious and talented Indian Parsi refugee, Farrokh Bulsara--sees a golden opportunity when the lead singer of the local band, Smile, decides to quit. With an incredible vocal range and a new name, the humble Zanzibar boy becomes Freddie Mercury--and along with the guitarist, Brian May; the drummer, Roger Taylor, and the bassist, John Deacon--they form the extremely successful British rock band, Queen. However, against the backdrop of the towering fame, the irrevocable bad decisions, and the fateful AIDS diagnosis, the Queen will have to reunite just in the nick of time for an extraordinary twenty-minute appearance at London&#039;s Wembley Stadium, during the 1985 Live Aid (1985) concert.

-------

Bohemian Rhapsody conjoins four major worlds concerning the rise of British rock band Queen during the nineteen seventies and eighties; we see a glimpse into their world of tours and the making of their 1975 album "A Night at the Opera", dealings within the music business and their respective loves and hates and highs and lows, the life of its charismatic leadman Freddie Mercury, his lovers&#039; and challenge with the AIDS HIV virus and their performance at London&#039;s Wembley Stadium at the 1985 world televised broadcast Live Aid concert.</p>
