  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Kyle and Sarah Miller have it all: a huge gated house on the water, fancy cars, and the potential for romance in their relationship. He&#039;s just back from a business trip (he brokers diamonds) and their teen daughter Avery is sneaking out to a party, when four thugs in security uniforms and ski masks stage a home invasion. They want what&#039;s in the safe: cash and diamonds. Kyle stalls them, trying to negotiate for Sarah&#039;s freedom. Over the next few hours, the back stories of the four robbers (two brothers, a girlfriend, and the representative of a local drug kingpin) as well as the fault lines in Kyle and Sarah&#039;s marriage come into play. Is there room here for heroism?</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A wealthy family fight back against a gang of ruthless criminals during a violent home invasion in this relentless nail-biter from director Joel Schumacher (8MM, Phone Booth). Powerful businessman Kyle (Nicolas Cage) lives in a private community with his gorgeous wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) and their rebellious teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato). Though security is tight in their affluent neighborhood, cunning thief Elias (Ben Mendelsohn) has spent months planning the perfect robbery, and his crew have the skills needed to pull it off. Meanwhile, Sarah is overseeing the renovations that Kyle has approved when her gaze begins to drift to the backyard of their sprawling estate and to a handsome worker (Cam Gigandet) as he tends to their pool. Then one night, without warning, a simple knock at the door changes everything. Their home suddenly overrun by a band of ruthless criminals whose polite demeanor masks a terrifying malevolence, the fractured family realize that the only way out alive is to trust one another and fight together to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. Trespass played at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.
