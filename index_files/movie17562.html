Once again we&#039;re plunged into the world of sword fights and "savvy" pirates. Captain Jack Sparrow is reminded he owes a debt to Davy Jones, who captains the flying Dutchman, a ghostly ship, with a crew from hell. Facing the "locker" Jack must find the heart of Davy Jones but to save himself he must get the help of quick-witted Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. If that&#039;s not complicated enough, Will and Elizabeth are sentenced to hang, unless Will can get Lord Cutler Beckett Jack&#039;s compass. Will is forced to join another crazy adventure with Jack.

-------

William and Elizabeth are sentenced to death for being in contact with Jack Sparrow. For saving Elizabeth, Will accepts to bring Jack&#039;s compass in exchange for his and Elizabeth&#039;s freedom. Meanwhile, Jack is being hunted by Davy Jones. Elizabeth escapes from prison to look for Will. Jack agrees to trade Will his compass if he finds a special key that will open a special chest. To find the key, Will goes aboard the Flying Dutchman, upon which he gets captured. He is reunited by his father on the Flying Dutchman. He finds the key and escapes the ship. Meanwhile, Jack gets Elizabeth to find the chest containing the heart of Davy Jones. Will and Elizabeth reunite on the island and open the chest and find the heart of Davy Jones. While Jack wants it to settle his debt to Jones, Will wants it to free his father and another person wants it for his own needs. Who is this mysterious person and what does he want to do with it?

-------

When ghostly pirate Davy Jones comes to collect a blood debt, Capt. Jack Sparrow must find a way to avoid his fate lest his soul be damned for all time. Nevertheless, the wily ghost manages to interrupt the wedding plans of Jack&#039;s friends Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.

-------

Once again thrown into the world of the supernatural, Captain Jack Sparrow finds out that he owes a blood debt to the legendary Davey Jones, Captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman. With time running out, Jack must find a way out of his debt or else be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife. And as if this weren&#039;t enough, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are arrested and sentenced to death unless Will can get Lord Beckett Jack&#039;s compass, who are forced to join Jack on yet another misadventure.

-------

Legend has it that a tortured soul called Davy Jones lives beneath the sea with a terrible sea beast at his command. Unfortunately for the notorious pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, this particular legend is very real. Years ago, Jack made a deal with Davy Jones, who is now expecting him to make good on his promise by handing himself over to Jones&#039;s servitude. But Jack will not give in without a fight, which is especially bad news for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who always seem to get caught up in Jack&#039;s mishaps. If Jack can&#039;t find a way to rid himself of Davy Jones once and for all, it may just spell the end for the three adventurers</p>
