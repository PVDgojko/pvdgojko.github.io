Six strangers, (Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny and Lewis Pullman) each with their own secrets, meet at the El Royale hotel of Lake Tahoe. Taking place over one night, alliances are made and secrets are revealed.

-------

Early 1970s. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel was once very popular but is now deserted, staffed by a single desk clerk. Some of the new guests&#039; reasons for being there are less than innocent and some and are not who they appear to be.

-------

1969. The gaudily decorated El Royale Motor Hotel, literally straddling the California/Nevada border located just outside of Tahoe, has seen better days, but almost simultaneously four individuals check-in - they the only four guests - all assisted by the only hotel employee working this day, the young clerk, Miles Miller. The four are: southern traveling salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, stereotypically brash as to his profession; aging Catholic priest Father Daniel Flynn who is showing early signs of Alzheimer&#039;s; struggling black singer Darlene Sweet, who has a gig in nearby Reno; and an angry young female hippie who refuses to divulge her name. Some of the four are not who they appear on the surface, those individuals having a very specific reason for choosing the El Royale beyond just needing a place to stay. The true stories of the four plus that of Miles become intertwined, with what happening affected by the dirty secrets of the El Royale. What happens between the five may also be affected by others who are looking for one or more of the five, either in helping them or reclaiming them for their own nefarious purposes.</p>
