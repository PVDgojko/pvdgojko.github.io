Against the backdrop of the costly War of the Spanish Succession in early-eighteenth-century England, the mud-covered former aristocrat, Abigail Hill, arrives at the palace with nothing, to beg for a job. However, with an ailing Queen Anne mostly tending to her furry herd of rabbits and the petulant monarch&#039;s faithful confidante, Sarah Churchill, subtly running the country, it won&#039;t be long before the castle&#039;s newest scullery maid spots a golden opportunity to restore her status. Now--amid rapacious ambition, creative emotional manipulation, and hidden personal agendas--the ferocious female antagonists have no other option but to wage a silent war for the attention of the sad empress; nevertheless, what will it take to become Queen Anne&#039;s favourite?</p>
