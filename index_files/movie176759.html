From visionary filmmaker Spike Lee comes the incredible true story of an American hero. It&#039;s the early 1970s, and Ron Stallworth is the first African-American detective to serve in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Determined to make a name for himself, Stallworth bravely sets out on a dangerous mission: infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan. The young detective soon recruits a more seasoned colleague, Flip Zimmerman, into the undercover investigation of a lifetime. Together, they team up to take down the extremist hate group as the organization aims to sanitize its violent rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream. Produced by the team behind the Academy-Award® winning Get Out (2017).

In the 70&#039;s, in Colorado Springs, the quirky Afro-American Ron Stallworth joins the police department and is assigned to work in the records room. Soon he offers to work undercover in the Narcotics, but his chief assigns him to infiltrate in a black movement led by Stokely Carmichael instead, where he meets the leader of the students Patrice Dumas. When he sees a Ku Klux Klan advertisement in the newspaper, Ron contacts the organization and is invited to join it. He convinces his chief to let the Jewish detective Flip Zimmerman to go to the meeting posing of Ron Stallworth and they both investigate the organization.

-------

In high hopes of becoming a detective, the rookie police officer and the first African-American member of the 1970s Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron Stallworth, summons up the courage to do the unthinkable: he applies to enrol in the local Ku Klux Klan chapter. But, is that even possible? With his fellow white Jewish partner, Flip Zimmerman, doing the undercover work, Ron will go to great lengths to expose the nefarious organisation&#039;s plans, setting in motion a boldly methodical and outrageous scheme right in the heart of KKK. However, for how long will Ron and Flip be able to keep going their increasingly dangerous charade?

-------

A semi-fictionalized account of Ron Stallworth, the first black officer hired in the Colorado Springs Police Department in 1978, is presented. His hiring in what was the still highly anti-black racist mentality of the force was to diversity it outwardly. Always wanting to be a policeman, Ron never embraced the black stereotype, he largely coming across as white except for his physical black characteristics. Not enjoying the menial tasks of the records room where he is initially assigned and where he is often bombarded with racial slurs by his fellow officers, he is able to convince his superiors that his unique attributes are better suited to undercover work. Those superiors want to assign him infiltrate a black activist student union group led by Patrice Dumas, they who are bringing in a black leader speaker, Kwame Ture, Ron&#039;s assignment to ensure that no radical activities take place especially during what is anticipated as the highly charged talk. In addition to this assignment, Ron, on a whim in answering a newspaper ad via a telephone call, is able to infiltrate the local chapter of the KKK, a subsequent call which makes its way to the national grand wizard himself, David Duke. His one big mistake in the telephone calls: using his real name. Ron thinks he has a way around this error by having one of his fellow undercover cops, Flip Zimmerman, to be "Ron Stallworth" in any meeting with the KKK, despite they sounding nothing alike. Much like Ron in not being typically "black", Flip, ethnically Jewish, was never devoted to his faith. This undercover work in its entirety places Ron&#039;s life in a precarious balance as he begins to embrace issues of his blackness, especially as it relates to Patrice. The further Ron and Flip infiltrate the KKK, the greater the likelihood of their cover being blown, risking their lives, many of the KKK members who are just itching at the chance to kill some n*****s and n-lovers, especially in some form of grand gesture.</p>
