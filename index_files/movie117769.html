  <br><p><b>Description: </b>It&#039;s the late 1980s, when Wall Street is riding high, and it seems as if the entire country is cashing in on the bumper profits. Disgusted with the materialism that surrounds him, Matt Franklin, a brilliant young MIT graduate, has walked out on his well-paid position at a local lab and taken a low-level job as a video clerk, much to his father Bill&#039;s consternation. And the crises keep piling up in Matt&#039;s life. His best buddy Barry has just gotten fired from his job, his brainy sister Wendy is getting hitched to her vapid boyfriend Kyle, and the gorgeous Tori Frederking, long-time object of Matt&#039;s unattainable adoration, is suddenly back in the picture. Now, on one wild, woolly and irresponsible evening, everything is coming to a head, with explosive results.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A floundering MIT graduate sends out the &#039;80s with a bang after being invited to an end-of-summer bash by his former high school crush in this nostalgia-flavored comedy starring Topher Grace, Anna Faris, and Dan Fogler. Matt Franklin (Grace) has just graduated from MIT, but he&#039;s content to spend his days stacking the shelves of his local Suncoast Video instead of going to work for a Fortune 500 company. Meanwhile, his sarcastic twin sister, Wendy (Faris), knows he can do better, and his best friend, Barry (Fogler), has a wild streak the size of the Mississippi River. When Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer) happens into the video store one day and strikes up a conversation with Matt, he compulsively lies about having a job at Goldman Sachs. Incredibly, Matt and Tori hit it off, and she invites him to join her for a massive summer blowout. The opportunity of a lifetime finally within reach, Matt arrives at the party in style, intent on sweeping Tori off her feet. Later, somewhere between the stolen car and the epic dance-off, Matt, Tori, Wendy, and Barry realize that this is the night they will still be thinking about when they&#039;re old and gray, and the neon-drenched &#039;80s are just a distant memory.
