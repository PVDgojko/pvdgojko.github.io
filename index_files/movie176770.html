-------

Hal, wayward prince and reluctant heir to the English throne, has turned his back on royal life and is living among the people. But after the death of Hal&#039;s brother (who was supposed to be the next King according to the declaration by King Henry IV) before Hal&#039;s tyrannical father himself dies putting Hal in the place of the King, Hal has no choice but to be crowned King Henry V and to embrace the life he had previously tried to escape. Now the young king must navigate the palace politics, chaos and enemies his father left behind, and must seek the help of his old long time friend, mentor and aging alcoholic knight, John Falstaff.</p>
