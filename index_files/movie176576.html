The script centers on two policemen, one an old-timer (Gibson), the other his volatile younger partner (Vaughn), who find themselves suspended when a video of their strong-arm tactics become the media&#039;s cause du jour. Low on cash and with no other options, these two embittered soldiers descend into the criminal underworld to gain their just due, but instead find far more than they wanted awaiting them in the shadows.

-------

What bad things will good men do for their families? A stolid, old guard policeman, Ridgeman "Gibson" and his volatile younger partner, Anthony "Vaughn", find themselves suspended when a video of them strong-arming a suspect becomes the media&#039;s special du jour. Low on cash and with no other options, these two embittered soldiers descend into the criminal underworld to gain their just due. On the other side of the law, Henry Jones comes home from years in prison to find his mother and disabled brother living in squalor. The ex-convict needs a way to help and to this end, his childhood friend Biscuit introduces him to a ruthless crime boss whose ambitious plans put him and his pal in direct conflict with the two renegade officers. In the hardboiled world of DRAGGED ACROSS CONCRETE, who lives, who dies, and who gets rich is a fate written in bullets.</p>
