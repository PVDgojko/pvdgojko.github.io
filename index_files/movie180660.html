The film follows Cecilia, who receives the news of her abusive ex-boyfriend&#039;s suicide. She begins to re-build her life for the better. However, her sense of reality is put into question when she begins to suspect her deceased lover is not actually dead.

-------

Summoning up every last ounce of courage, the deeply traumatised architect, Cecilia Kass, sneaks away from the lavish seaside mansion of her brilliant but harmfully controlling optics engineer boyfriend, Adrian Griffin, in the dead of night. However, no place, no matter how far away, is safe from manipulative Adrian--and even though Cecilia has found refuge in the house of a dear friend--she knows that, sooner or later, she will have to confront him once again. Then, suddenly, perversely joyous news reaches Kass, and for the first time in a long while, she feels free; nevertheless, eerie instances of an unseen presence haunting and watching her every step suggest otherwise. But, fear is the worst enemy. Is Cecilia starting to lose her grip on reality, or has the invisible man found a way to pick up where he left off?</p>
