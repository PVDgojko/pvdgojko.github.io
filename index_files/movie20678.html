Tired of her husband&#039;s philandering ways, the mother of two daughters drowns her husband. With the reluctant help of the local coroner, the murder is covered up. Her daughters are having similar problems with relationships, and tend to follow their mother&#039;s example, and the coroner becomes reluctantly involved in their murders as well. As the plot progresses, visual and spoken numbers appear in the scenes, counting from one to one hundred.

-------

Three generations of women, a mother, her daughter, and her niece - all called Cissie Colpitts - experience dissatisfaction with their husbands and cause them to drown. The local coroner, an inveterate game player called Madgett (Bernard Hill), is drawn into a plot to disguise the murders. The story is paced by the numbers one to one hundred, which appear sequentially through this movie.</p>
