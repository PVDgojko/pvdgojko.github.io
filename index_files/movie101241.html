  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Johan, convicted for the murder of his father and sister, has been locked up in a TBS clinic (a hospital for criminals with a psychical disorder) for years. When he hears he will be transfered to a Long Stay ward - where nobody has ever been released from - he hopes his mother, who he hasn&#039;t spoken for years, will come to his hearing so she can tell the judge he didn&#039;t murder his sister, that his father abused him and was about to abuse his sister and that Johan therefore killed his father. However, his mother doesn&#039;t turn up. Realizing he&#039;s out of options, he escapes, determined to find his mother, so she can write a statement saying what really happened. Pretty soon however, he gets pursued by the police and in a rather desperate attempt to stay out of their hands, he kidnaps a 13-year old girl, Tessa. Together they drive through the Netherlands and Belgium to find his mother.</p>
