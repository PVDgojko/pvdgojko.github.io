On Cybertron, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are on the verge of losing the Great Cybertronian War to their enemies, the Decepticons, had begin making preparations to leave the planet. The Decepticons led by Shockwave, Soundwave and Starscream ambush them during the evacuation, and Optimus sends a young scout, B-127, to Earth in order to set up a base of operations where the Autobots can regroup. B-127 reaches Earth alone in 1987, crash-landing in California and disrupting a training exercise being conducted by Sector 7, a secret government agency that monitors extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Sector 7 agent Colonel Jack Burns presumes B-127 to be a hostile invader and attacks, driving B-127 into the forest, where he is then ambushed by the Decepticon Blitzwing. When B-127 refuses to reveal Optimus&#039; whereabouts, Blitzwing spitefully tears out his voice-box and damages his memory core. B-127 manages to destroy Blitzwing before collapsing from his wounds. Before entering stasis, B-127 scans and transforms into a yellow 1967 Volkswagen Beetle.

-------

After being defeated by the Decepticons in the war on Cybertron, the Autobot leader Optimus Prime sends B-127 to Earth to establish an outpost and protect Earth. B-127 surprises the training of a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Jack Burns and escapes. However, he is ambushed by a Deception that damages his memory core and voice-box. But B-127 defeats the enemy and transforms into a yellow 1967 Volkswagen Beetle. In 1987, the eighteen-year-old Charlie Watson finds the Beetle in a junkyard and the owner Hank gives the car to her. The teenager is a great mechanic that misses her father and lives with her young brother and her estranged mother and her boyfriend. Charlie accidentally activates a signal and the Decepticons track down B-127 on Earth. Two Decepticons head for Earth to capture and destroy the Autobot convincing Dr. Powell and the army that they are peaceful and the enemy is a dangerous robot. Meanwhile, Charlie befriends B-127 and calls him Bumblebee.</p>
