Joe Sullivan is itching to get out of prison. He&#039;s taken the rap for Rick, who owes him $50,000. Rick sets up an escape for Joe, knowing that Joe will be caught escaping and be shot or locked away forever. But with the help of his love-struck girl Pat and his sympathetic legal caseworker Ann, Joe gets further than he&#039;s supposed to, and we are posed with two very important questions: Is Joe really the cold and heartless criminal he appears to be, or is there a heart of gold under that gritty exterior? And does Joe belong with the tough, street-wise Pat, or with the prim, moralizing Ann?

-------

Joe Sullivan is in the state prison taking the blame for the gangster Rick Coyle that owes him US $50,000. Joe is visited by the young Ann Martin that works at the law firm that is defending him and she tells that after three years, Joe will certainly be on probation. However his lover Pat also visits him and tells that Rick has plotted an escape for him during the night. What they do not know is that the sadistic Rick wants to get rid off Joe and expects that Joe will be shot or caught during the prison break. Joe succeeds in the escape and Pat drives the getaway car. However the car is shot in the tank by the police officers and they run out fuel. Joe brings Pat to Ann&#039;s house expecting to have a hideout for a couple of days, but Ann tries to call the police believing that she would help Joe. They escape in Ann&#039;s car with her as a hostage and head to Crescent City, where Joe expects to meet Rick to receive his money and travel to South America with Pat. But Rick sends a hit man to kill Joe while Pat feels that she is losing Joe to Ann that has fallen in love with him. Will Pat and Joe have the chance to travel together to South America?</p>
