Harry does whatever he can, unsuccessfully, to find out the location of the $10,000 from Ben. After Ben&#039;s execution, Harry decides that Willa will be his next mark, figuring that someone in the family knows where the money is hidden. Despite vowing not to remarry, Willa ends up being easy prey for Harry&#039;s outward ...</p>
