In this third installment of the adrenaline-fueled action franchise, skilled assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns with a $14 million price tag on his head and an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail. After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin&#039;s guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world&#039;s most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn.

-------

After gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy international assassin&#039;s guild -- legendary hit man John Wick finds himself stripped of the organization&#039;s protective services. Now stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the world&#039;s most ruthless killers.

-------

John Wick is on the run for two reasons, as he is being hunted for a global $14 million dollar open contract on his life, and for breaking a central rule: taking a life on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim was a member of the High Table who ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, except the Continental&#039;s manager, Winston, has given him a one-hour grace period before he&#039;s &#039;Excommunicado&#039; - membership revoked, banned from all services and cut off from other members. John uses the service industry to stay alive as he fights and kills his way out of New York City.

-------

Heavily outgunned and with a glorious bounty placed on his head after the blood-soaked events in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), the legendary virtuoso of death, John Wick, finds himself all on his own in the dark underbelly of Manhattan&#039;s vast urban battlefield. With every ambitious nobody in the business itching to terminate the excommunicated cardinal of destruction, John has to do battle with pitilessly endless waves of the High Table&#039;s murderous cut-throats, against the backdrop of a fatal mistake at the neutral Continental Hotel, and a long-standing feud over an innocent puppy. Indeed, many have tried to claim John&#039;s head; however, dead men can&#039;t spend money. Now, the artist of suffering prepares for war. Don&#039;t they know who the Bogeyman is?</p>
