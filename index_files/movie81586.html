  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Kay and Arnold are a middle-aged couple whose marriage has declined until they are now sleeping in separate rooms and barely interact in any meaningful loving way. Finally, Kay has had enough and finds a book by Dr. Feld which inspires her to sign them up for the Doctor&#039;s intense week long marriage counseling session. Although Arnold sees nothing wrong with their 30 year long marriage, he reluctantly agrees to go on the expensive excursion. What follows is an insightful experience as Dr. Feld manages to help the couple understand how they have emotionally drifted apart and what they can do to reignite their passion. Even with the Doctor&#039;s advice, Kay and Arnold find that renewing their marriage&#039;s fire is a daunting challenge for them both.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>An aging couple strive to conquer their sexual hang-ups and save their 30-year marriage from going stale by visiting a renowned couple&#039;s therapist in this comedy from director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada, Marley &amp; Me). After three decades of marriage, Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) still love each other deeply. But somewhere along the way, their passion for one another seems to have perished. Upon learning about a relationship therapist (Steve Carell) in Great Hope Springs whose methods have yielded incredible results, Kay pleads with Arnold to sign up for a weeklong session. Little does the committed couple realize that overcoming years of sexual repression will prove to be quite an exhausting challenge.
