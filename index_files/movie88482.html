Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past, Angelica (Penélope Cruz), and he&#039;s not sure if it&#039;s love, or if she&#039;s a ruthless con artist who&#039;s using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne&#039;s Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn&#039;t know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.

-------

In London, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escapes from the soldiers that are chasing him and learns that an impostor is recruiting a crew and a vessel using his name. He meets the impersonator and finds that she actually is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), a woman that he had seduced in a convent in Seville. Jack is abducted and when he awakens aboard, the ship is sailing, Angelica tells him that her father, the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), is cursed and he needs to find the legendary Ponce de Leon&#039;s Fountain of Youth to save his life. They force Jack, who knows the location of the fountain, to guide them. Meanwhile, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hired by King George (Richard Griffiths) to lead the British crew and dispute against the Spaniards, and Blackbeard, who arrives first to the fountain. But along their dangerous quest, they need to first find two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid.

-------

Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), along with the feared pirate Edward Teach, a.k.a. Blackbeard (Ian McShane), and a mysterious woman from his past, Angelica (Penélope Cruz), race to the infamous Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, the Spanish have sent some ships to go looking for the Fountain and to counter them, the English have sent their own ship under the Captainship of the pirate-turned-privateer Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). While Blackbeard is seeking the Fountain to Save his own skin, Barbossa has a vendetta of his own. Who will be the one to reach the Fountain of Youth before the others?</p>
