When her mentally ill mother passes away, a woman named Annie (Toni Collette) and her husband (Gabriel Byrne), son (Alex Wolff) and daughter (Milly Shapiro) all mourn her loss. The family turn to different means to handle their grief, including Annie and her daughter both flirting with the supernatural. They each begin to have disturbing, otherworldly experiences linked to the sinister secrets and emotional trauma that have been passed through the generations of their family.

-------

Annie is a wealthy model maker with a family history of mental instability. After her elderly mother passes away, Annie, her disturbed daughter, Charlie, and, eventually, her teenaged son, Peter, begin to experience strange visions and compulsions, much to the distress of her skeptical husband, Steve.

-------

As the miniature artist, Annie Graham, and her family prepare for her mother&#039;s funeral--the unbearably complex and cryptic septuagenarian, Ellen Leigh--unsettling occurrences and palpable spiritual manifestations start nestling in the secluded house&#039;s dark corners. Then--as a thick veil of grief, guilt, and a sinfully pleasant sense of relief shroud the already troubled mother--more and more, the mounting distress of Annie&#039;s thirteen-year-old daughter, Charlie, becomes evident, as her older brother, Peter, begins to feel the relentless anguish of culpability. Now, little by little, a sinister dark presence robs Annie of her free will, demanding a cruel sacrifice in exchange for glorious rewards. Will the Grahams ever shake off the macabre connection to the unseen realm, especially when evil seems to be hereditary?</p>
