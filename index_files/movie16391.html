He is later dismissed from his job on the basis of an anonymous note accusing him of being too friendly with little schoolgirls. His daughter&#039;s boyfriend takes up his cause, assuming that the PTA president sent the note out of spite. It turns out that the note was sent by a woman living across the street from the school, who knew the guard from another city, and feared he would expose her past life. Story is told with the same incident repeated from several different viewpoints.</p>
