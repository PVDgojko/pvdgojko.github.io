  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Nine contestants work as a team to answer general knowledge questions against the clock and amass prize money up to a total of £1,000 per round. After each round, the contestants vote for whoever they consider the worst player. That player is the Weakest Link and is forced to endure the humiliating Walk of Shame. This continues with a decreasing time limit until only two players are left. They play head to head to decide the victor. Only the final winner wins any money. The other eight players leave with nothing. Host Anne Robinson is on hand to provide scathing commentary on the players&#039; progress (or lack thereof), armed with her legendary catch-phrase: "You are the Weakest Link: goodbye!"</p>

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

An immensely successful TV gameshow that has become successful because of how nasty it is.With the sly,condescending host Anne Robinson ,contestants are randomly voted off for losing the team money and for not being bright enough.What gets me more than anything is who is Robinson to speak down to the statistical/actual &#039;weakest link&#039;,she is a mere host herself and certainly no nuclear psyician,in what position is she to make other people feel stupid and insignificant?Why doesn&#039;t SHE take the hotspot for once?If not having to face the possible (there can only be one winner) humiliation of being voted off isn&#039;t enough to deter you,imagine the frustration of another contestant being asked a question to which you know the answer but they don&#039;t,and vice versa.There are many other game shows you can go on with the possibility of winning large sums of money other than this,such as Millionaire and My Kind of Music ,where you are consoled for being the loser,apply to go on them instead.**</p>
