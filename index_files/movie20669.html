  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Life in the trenches of that most honorable and frustrating profession...teaching. It&#039;s the start of a memorable new year at Harrison High. The self-conscious Mr. Stroope is convinced that his time has come - this year he will be furnished with the golden title of "Teacher of the Year," if only his smarter students would stop using words that he can&#039;t understand. Peek into Mr. Lowrey&#039;s History class and you&#039;ll see that he&#039;s struggling to even call himself a teacher. Woefully inept due to a complete lack of experience and social skills, he earnestly stutters his way through class. The only interaction his students offer him is when they steal his chalk. Men aren&#039;t much interested in the spunky and officious Coach Webb, but "not all P.E. teachers are gay" and she pines for some romantic company. Her once best friend, the newly appointed assistant principal, Mrs. Reddell, doesn&#039;t seem to have time for her either, as her new power post is all-consuming; battling egos, enduring teacher conferences and her lighthouse-obsessed boss. Coach Webb wonders if her former confidante has forgotten just how hard teaching really is.

An improvisational take on the high school experience, told from the educators&#039; point-of-view.</p>
