  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Darius is a young intern at a Seattle-based magazine and jumps at the chance to investigate the author of a classified ad seeking someone to travel back in time with. Along with Jeff, the staff writer, and Arnau, a fellow intern, the three go on a road trip to a coastal town. While Jeff just wants to chase after his high school crush and Arnau wants some kind of life experience, Darius spends her time with Kenneth, a man who believes that he has built a time machine. The closer they become and the more they understand about each other, the less clear it becomes if Kenneth is just crazy or if he actually is going to successfully travel back in time.</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>A personal ad placed for a time-travel partner prompts an investigation involving three magazine reporters in this quirky comedy produced by Mark and Jay Duplass (Jeff, Who Lives at Home) and starring Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation). Kenneth is a self-proclaimed time traveler who doesn&#039;t want to take his next journey alone. Intrigued by Kenneth&#039;s cryptic ad, a local newspaper editor dispatches cynical reporter Darius (Plaza) and a pair of other employees to get the scoop. Upon meeting Kenneth, Darius see past his peculiar front and recognizes the lonely soul inside. As genuine as Kenneth may be, however, his questionable sanity leaves Darius uncertain of how to proceed with her story.
