  <br><p><b>Description: </b>Four women have given up on getting their men to do what they want until they find a how to book</p>
  <br><p><b>Comments: </b>This adaptation of Steve Harvey&#039;s non-fiction relationship advice book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man focuses on six friends who regularly get together to play basketball, and usually are commiserating about women issues. Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) is a geeky pothead and comic-book obsessive whose career is stuck in neutral and who won&#039;t pop the question to his girlfriend of nine years. Zeke (Romany Malco) is a former musician-turned-businessman who is great at picking up the ladies but can&#039;t commit to a long-term relationship. Michael (Terrence J) is good looking and charming, but his mother still has him wrapped around her finger and doesn&#039;t want to let him go. Dominic (Michael Ealy) keeps changing career goals, and while he&#039;s an excellent chef, he hasn&#039;t found a way to make it pay. And short, motormouthed Cedric (Kevin Hart) is in the midst of a divorce and can&#039;t wait to be free of his wife. Nerdy but well-meaning Bennett (Gary Owen) is the only one in a functioning relationship, and he gets a lot of grief from his buddies for his happy marriage.
